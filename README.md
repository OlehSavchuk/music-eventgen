This is a workflow for generating initial conditions using Trento (https://github.com/Duke-QCD/trento) and evolving hydrodynamically using a modified version of MUSIC (https://github.com/MUSIC-fluid/MUSIC/tree/public_stable). 

See the local and/or NERSC directories for installation instructions.

The run-events script is adapted from https://github.com/Duke-QCD/hic-eventgen/tree/master. Though many of the usage instructions there are obsolete due to the different models used, it may still be a useful reference for general usage of the run-events executable.
